          Sometimes we wake up every day and find ourselves facing many problems and difficulties, 
          whether they are big barriers or small walls. The truth is that we never stop to think about
           how we choose to deal with it and how it affects us.<br>
          In a time long past our own, which came long before the creation of time itself and the counting 
          of years. The first life forms to be created were the descendants of the sun and the descendants 
          of the moon. Both peoples had their own ways of acting and thinking. 
          The children of the sun shone with the light of their ancestors, while with the children of the moon, 
          we can see all the delicacy and brilliance of the moon.
          <br>But since they didn't have their own light, it was common for them to reflect the brightness of 
          the children of the sun so that both could always live together and, at the same time, be distant, 
          because perhaps the most intriguing fact about this strange land is that everyone always knew that in reality, 
          the two sides of this same world were separated by a barrier that could not be seen or touched, from the center 
          of the earth to the home of the heavenly beings high up in the heavens. And 
          if anyone dared to touch this barrier, the wrath of the celestials would immediately fall upon them, and they 
          would be immediately punished having their lives completely erased in the same instant, which would separate them for 
          all eternity. So even if these beings needed each other very much, they never even exchanged a few glances, not 
          for a bad reason, just because they had no choice but 
          to respect the will of the heavenly celestial beings to leave both sides apart, since they could in no way do anything to change this.

        <p class="history-text">But apparently, sometimes there are those who always think
          a little out of the box, those who always want to look for a different
          way of doing something instead of just accepting the way everyone wants something done.
           Not that's a bad thing, far from it, I think the world could perhaps
          be a little more like this for a change.
          
          <br>
          It just so happens that one day we come across a certain descendant of the sun who could very well fit into this
          class of always living beyond his own mind, a hitherto ordinary guy that we can call Sunset was
          wandering around, lost in his own thoughts, when he suddenly came across a curious scene of a girl observing a tree and writing everything down in her simple notebook. She was a descendant of the moon—that's right, from the other side of the wall.
          A scene that left Sunset quite intrigued and thoughtful.
          So he watched for a while, until he realized that the girl was actually taking note of the behavior of some birds that lived in that tree. This fact intrigued him, since a scene like that was something that wasn't a very common occurrence for beings of that time, so he believed it when he realized he finally found someone who could think beyond, just like him.
          <br>
          Sunset approached the wall and greeted the girl with a nice smile. She seemed delighted and ended up 
          returning the kindness. At that moment, Sunset ended up pulling a book out of her pocket—a small book 
          of poems—choosing your favorite and showing  it to her. She seemed confused by it all. At that moment,
           he ended up pointing at the girl as if he were questioning her about what her name would be; that's when 
           she raised her notebook with her name written. Sunset came across very  different shapes and unique lines, 
           until he realizes they had totally different languages.
          <br>
          So what can Sunset do to find out more about the girl who caught your attention? Could this be a sign that, in fact, the celestial beings do not want the two to meet? Could this, then, be a second wall separating the two?

          <p class="history-text">
            That's when the girl observed his confused reaction to her answer—that she understood that they were two totally different 
            languages, which made her think a little and caught his attention. Sunset was noted slowly as the girl pointed to herself and, 
            soon after, pointed to the moonlight reflected in a puddle of water on the floor, on the other side of the wall. 
             With her advanced intellect, Sunset understood that the girl was called Moonlight, and she did it at the same point as yourself 
            and then made the sign that he seemed to ask her to wait for him. Then they both looked carefully and noticed that the sun was 
            beginning to disappear over the horizon, since they both spent the whole afternoon talking, and it was here that Sunset pointed at himself. 
            At the sun that was slowly descending through the horizon, Moonlight immediately understood and recognized his name as Sunset, 
            giving a beautiful smile. In that world, the sun and moon were born on both sides and corresponded to their children. And like the sun that rises and then sets on the same side, the moon follows the same pattern. 
            Somehow, the celestial beings of this world eventually made the moon capable of storing some of the sunlight for use at night, a unique and certain inexplicable form of this 
            strangely well-organized land.
