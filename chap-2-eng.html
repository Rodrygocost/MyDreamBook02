          Since they didn't understand each other in written form, they had the idea of
          ​simplifying how they communicated, because they really wanted to get to know each other. 
          Several days passed, and the two became closer and closer to each other, since even though 
          they were separated by a divine will, they managed to establish a connection that defied 
          the laws of the very universe in which they lived. After so many afternoons sharing their worlds, 
          their ideas, and their feelings that they never imagined sharing with anyone one day. 
          They quickly realized that they had ignited a spark that was both beautiful and dangerous ate the same time, 
          delicate and deadly, which made them feel good and scared them. They had discovered the purest and most sincere 
          way to love—love in all its essence, something that does not respect limits or standards, but only the will of 
          two begins to be together.
          <br>
          Then, Sunset and Moonlight began to wonder in their minds If one day the two could actually be together. 
          They place their hands next to each other on the edge of the wall very close to the edge with the most intense 
          desire to be side by side and look at each other with immense passion as lonely tears ran down her cheeks soon 
          before falling and drying on the lawn, They place their hands next to each other on the edge of the wall very 
          close to the edge with the most intense desire to be side by side and look at each other with immense passion 
          wondering why the celestial beings did this to them, the reason the world be a place so unfair as to make two 
          people who for the first time in your entire life found a reason, a reason to keep fighting all day, being unable
           to achieve the only thing in the world that makes them feel good.

          Determined to be together, and being probably the two most brilliant minds on earth, the two decided to join forces so 
          that they could reach some kind of conclusion, or way to break down that barrier that was declared enemy number one 
          of the love that those two felt for each other. They spent days searching, analyzing, and, in a way, delicately studying 
          that barrier in every way they could, since other objects of nature could pass freely through that wall, but for some celestial 
          reason those beings could never do such a thing. It seemed that every step they tried to advance resulted in two steps further 
          away from a correct answer to that question in their studies, which often caused them to become somewhat exhausted and tired 
          of searching for something that simply couldn't be done. Being exploited or defeated—I think this feeling is a little common 
          for us. Searching for something bigger and fighting as best as we can to achieve it, at the same time that everything around 
          you seems to judge you and make your path difficult, but the truth is that most things in the universe are totally out of our 
          control. This is simply frustrating, but that's no reason to just give up on continuing to move forward, which is why Sunset 
          and Moonlight always woke up with a smile on their faces, using that flame as fuel and struggling to find some reason for it all.
        </p>

          <p class="history-text">
            One day, already completely exhausted, but still with hope, the two approached that barrier that everyone saw as the definition of death,
             looked at each other slowly as the sun descended linearly across the horizon, and gave their last smile. When they looked closely at each other, 
             they realized that they were no longer going to obey in any way that natural order that the world forced those two souls to follow; 
             they decided that they had already stolen from them the only thing that had ever made sense: having each other. In an act of courage, 
             right after her last smile, Moonlight raised her five fingers high, and immediately Sunset understood that this would be like a final countdown. 
             As the fingers were lowered one by one, the two remembered all those days that they spent together, how they hated that barrier, 
             and how they only had to be grateful for the last and best days of their lives. When the last finger had been lowered, 
             the two closed their eyes and ran towards each other, when suddenly they felt something totally different, a sensation never seen before, 
             as if they were outside themselves and their own bodies, until they reached the conclusion that they had been erased from existence and were 
             in the home of the celestials, where they would rest there for all eternity. But when they opened their eyes, they both realized that, in fact, 
             their lips had touched and that they were not on another plane, but that they had just experienced the purest and truest kiss ever given
              in all the universes. While everyone else looked at them with amazement, they shed tears and smiled happily because they had finally understood 
              everything and could now live together for the rest of their lives.
          </p>

            The truth is that there never was a wall; all the time, this wall only existed inside their own heads, built stone by stone, by fear, 
            fear and frustration. Those who have never really tried before have built a wall so that, like them, others would also not be able to succeed, 
            because the truth is that it becomes much easier not to even try. The only wall that really exists is the one we create in our minds as an excuse not
             to truly strive for what we want so much for our future.
          <br>
          What about the rest of the story? I prefer, in fact, to present you with a question: is it better to face our walls as a problem or a celestial barrier, 
          or accept that they are the result of our fears and learn that the important thing is not the wall itself, but the way we let it affects us, and how can 
          we grow so much taller than it? The answer is inside you somewhere, but from here begins a one-way path that we can only truly travel alone.
